biobash
=======

A collection of bash scripts for bioinformatics.

* ```cleannames.sh``` : Takes NCBI formatted FASTA file and generates a new FASTA file with only the accessions.
* ```countntbl.sh``` : Generates a table with sequence names and the number of 'N's in the sequence.
* ```countseq.sh``` : Counts sequences in a FASTA file.
* ```dedup.sh``` : Removes exact duplicates from a FASTA file. From a tip by Pierre Lindenbaum (see https://www.biostars.org/p/3003/).
* ```degap.sh``` : Degaps a FASTA file (see https://www.biostars.org/p/302104/).
* ```extractacc.sh``` : Takes NCBI formatted FASTA file and generates a text file with the accessions.
* ```extractseq.sh``` : Takes FASTA file and extracts only the sequence.
* ```fas2csv.sh``` : Converts FASTA into tab-separated file.
* ```fas2phylip.sh``` : Converts FASTA to phylip format, useful for phyml.
* ```lenseq.sh``` : Returns length of all sequences in a FASTA file.
* ```linfasta.sh``` : Converts a FASTA file into linearized sequences (i.e. alternating titles and sequences). Taken from a hint by Frederic Mahe (see http://www.biostars.org/p/17680).
* ```longorf.sh``` : Extracts the longest open reading frame. Requires ```getorf``` from EMBOSS.
* ```numbersequences.sh``` : Renames sequences with 'X' followed by a number. Use in conjunction with ```seqnametable.sh```.
* ```relabel.sh```: Relabels sequences using a stub concatenated with a numeric index.
* ```removesmalls.sh``` : Removes sequences shorter than a given threshold. Taken from a hint by Frederic Mahe (see http://www.biostars.org/p/79202/).
* ```seqnametable.sh``` : Generates a tab-separated file of new names generated by ```numbersequences.sh``` and the original name.
* ```sortfasta.sh``` : Sorts a FASTA file into sequences of decreasing length.
* ```startatname.sh``` : Prints a FASTA file beginning at a given sequence name.
* ```stopatname.sh``` : Prints a FASTA file until (and including) a given sequence name.
* ```translate.sh```: Uses ```transeq``` from EMBOSS to translate sequences, but removes the additional numbering introduced by ```transeq```.
* ```trimorf.sh```: Trims non-coding regions from the beginning and end of a sequence. Requires ```getorf``` from EMBOSS.
* ```tsv2fas.sh```: Converts a tab-delimited file (name,sequence with no header to FASTA.
